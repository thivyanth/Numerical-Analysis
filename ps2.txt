Write a computer program to perform polynomial interpolation of arbitrary order (n)
using the following methods:
(a) Newton's Fundamental Formula
(b) Lagrange Interpolation scheme
(c) Aitken's iterative interpolation scheme.
Your program should prompt the user for: (a) which method to use, (b) order of
the interpolation polynomial (n), and (c) value of x at which interpolation needs to be
performed. After that either it should read {x0, . . . xn} and {f0,
. . . , fn} from the input,
or generate these quantities in a separate subroutine for the specifed function. Your
task will be simplified if you store these values in arrays. To allow for an arbitrary value
of n, use dynamic memory allocation for these, and, other arrays. Your interpolation
subroutines should be fully general so that they allow interpolation of any function,
and not just a particular function. Try your program for the function f(x) = cos(x),
with 0 ≤ x ≤ 1, and xi = ih (0 ≤ i ≤ n), for various values of n and x. Note, here we
are assuming equispaced arguments with h = (xn − x0)/n. Also print out the value of
cos(x) computed by the corresponding inbuilt function. A check of your code is that
for a given value of x and n, all the methods should yield the same result.
Coding Hints: For method (a) you need the divided dierences of the form f[xi
, xi+1, . . . xi+k]
with 0 ≤ i ≤ n and 0 ≤ k ≤ n. It is most convenient to store them in a two dimensional array (Fortran 90 notation) diff(0 : n, 0 : n), as diff(i, k). Note that then they can
be generated recursively using the inititalization diff(i, 0) = fi and the recursion relation
diff(i, k) = (diff(i + 1, k − 1) − diff(i, k − 1))/(xk+i − xi). Note that a similar scheme can be
used to store and generate the Aitken's array elements pi,i+1,i+2,...i+k.
